# NigerianHeritageQuiz

Introduction
This app was developed for the Android Basics course #7DaysofCodeChallenge which is part of the Google Africa Challenge scholarship program with ALC and Udacity.
In developing this app I have tried to combine all the things I learnt in this awesome course.

Topic
The topic Nigeria Heritage was chosen because the influence of western civilisation on Africa has adversely affected the traditional cultures of the indigenous African people and the over dependence on the western style of education has greatly limited the passing down of our history. This quiz will help preserve the culture and history of Africa, specifically Nigeria.

Structure
It is a short quiz of 10 questions, the user is expected to attempt all. The root layout is a scroll view, each question is presented on a cards created with nested layouts. There is 1 question with CheckBoxes, 1 with an EditText view and 8 question with radio buttons for the options. The are two buttons for submit and reset. After the user has answered all question and taps on the submit button the final score is displayed as a toast.
